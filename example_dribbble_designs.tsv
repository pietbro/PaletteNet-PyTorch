The uniqueness is that there is a wheel of balance on which displayed different areas of your life, goals and plans. It may seem that this can be done in a regular notebook, but it is more convenient when you see your goal and the percentage by which you have already advanced to it, right?. A convenient and pleasant interface is connected with well-thought-out logic and a system for working with your data. It’s not boring to make plans, it’s cool and effective!***Chat with us, just sending us a note hello@outcrowd.io Be a part of our creator’s community at:   Medium | Instagram | Twitter"	"{""Very cool) I love this style)))"","" Thanks a lot Alina!
